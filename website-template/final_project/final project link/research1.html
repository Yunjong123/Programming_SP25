      <h1>Directive Prism: Internal Behavior Shaping Protocol (2016)</h1>

      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        Eclipse Dom's Behavioral Influence Lab initiated Directive Prism to test whether algorithmic sequencing—rather than content—could guide human attention, emotion, and decision-making without direct awareness.
      </p>

      <h3>Experiment Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1,200 subjects unknowingly enrolled in a "personalized news feed beta"</li>
        <li>AI tracked user input: scroll speed, hesitation, and dwell time</li>
        <li>Content order was modified based on emotional reactivity</li>
        <li>No content was deleted—only the order was manipulated</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>84% showed measurable shifts in opinion after 14 days</li>
        <li>71% showed increased bias toward emotionally reinforced content</li>
        <li>Only 4% suspected they were part of an experiment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The success of Directive Prism led to internal discussions regarding long-term integration into major civilian platforms.  
        Leaked documents reference a potential "Phase II" including biometric feedback loops and real-time physiological input.
